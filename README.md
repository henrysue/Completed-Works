Abstract

The ocean sequesters carbon in the deep ocean via the production and sinking of particulate organic carbon from the surface. Understanding the sequestration of carbon by organic matter flux requires accurate prediction of the size-dependent sinking speeds of organic particles. Particle sinking speeds can be calculated using Stokesâ€™ Law, which predicts sinking speed based on particle radius and density. Additionally, an extended model is used here to predict the sinking speeds of diatoms by accounting for the additional frustle of the diatom. We estimate global export of particulate organic carbon from the euphotic zone by combining estimated particle sinking speed and a satellite product of marine particle abundance. Seawater viscosity is computed from satellite derived sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity. Validation against in-situ particle flux data is relatively weak, pointing to directions for possible improvement of the model.
